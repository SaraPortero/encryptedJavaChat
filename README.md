# Encrypted Multiclient Chat in Java
The following is the code to create a simple encrypted multiclient chat in Java.
Inside the src folder of the project there are three folders:
1. Client: holds the files to execute the client
2. Server: holds the files to execute the server
3. encryptedChat: is the main of the project, currently does nothing

In order to the project I used the following sources:
- For the basic chat part: https://github.com/gyawaliamit7/MultiClientSocket
- For the encryption part: https://reintech.io/blog/java-cryptography-encrypting-decrypting-data-tutorial
- To convert string to SecretKey: https://www.baeldung.com/java-secret-key-to-string
