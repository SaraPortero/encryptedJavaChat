# Encrypted Multiclient Chat in Java
The following is the code to create a simple encrypted multiclient chat in Java.
Inside the src folder of the project there are three folders:
1. Client: holds the files to execute the client
2. Server: holds the files to execute the server
3. encryptedChat: is the main of the project, currently does nothing

In order to complete the project I used the following sources:
- For the basic chat part: https://github.com/gyawaliamit7/MultiClientSocket
- For the encryption part: https://reintech.io/blog/java-cryptography-encrypting-decrypting-data-tutorial
- To convert string to SecretKey: https://www.baeldung.com/java-secret-key-to-string
# FAQ
## How to use the code
Each folder (server and client) has a main file, called either ServerMain or ClientMain. To execute each main, you will need the files in that same folder.
Put simply, you need to download the project, and execute the main that you to use.
The code is commented.

## Why did I do this?
It was a uni project for a network communications class.

## Can I use the project?
You may use the code as you feel, but if you are a big tech company you are welcome to invite me to dinner.
